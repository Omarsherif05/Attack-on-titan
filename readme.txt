Attack on Titan Project
This project simulates a simple Attack on Titan data management system using Java and CSV files to manage titans and weapons.

Code Structure
Titan.java: Defines the Titan class, holding information like name, height, abilities, and threat level.
Weapon.java: Defines the Weapon class for weapon attributes like type, range, and effectiveness against titans.
Main.java: The main entry point that handles CSV file reading and writing for titans and weapons, and simulates interactions between them.
CSV Files
titans.csv: Stores titan information.
weapons.csv: Stores weapon information.
How it Works
The program loads data from CSV files into Titan and Weapon objects.
Allows for querying, adding, and managing data about titans and weapons.
Potential for expansions like simulating battles or adding new data types.
